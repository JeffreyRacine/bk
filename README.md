This repository contains presentation slides for a joint project with Angda Li and Qi Li.

*We consider nonparametric kernel estimation of conditional density functions in bounded and unbounded support settings when bounds on the responses $Y$ are known or unknown and the multivariate responses and covariates $X$ may consist of mixed categorical and continuous data types. When bounds $[a,b]$ on the continuous responses are unknown, we advocate using the empirical support (i.e., $[\min(Y_i),\max(Y_i)]$) in their place. We jointly select the order of the approximating local polynomial $p$ and bandwith vectors via likelihood cross-validation. This fully data-driven approach thereby  i) automatically adapts to unknown bounds, ii) frees the practitioner from having to adopt a given polynomial order in an ad hoc manner, and iii) admits a mix of datatypes often encountered in applied settings. Simulations indicate that this approach is competitive with existing methods in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) in infinite $Y$ support settings and is particularly useful when the distribution of $Y$ is bounded but the bounds are not known a priori.*
