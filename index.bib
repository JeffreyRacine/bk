abstract = {Standard fixed symmetric kernel-type density estimators are known to encounter problems for positive random variables with a large probability mass close to zero. It is shown that, in such settings, alternatives of asymmetric gamma kernel estimators are superior, but also differ in asymptotic and finite sample performance conditionally on the shape of the density near zero and the exact form of the chosen kernel. Therefore, a refined version of the gamma kernel with an additional tuning parameter adjusted according to the shape of the density close to the boundary is suggested. A data-driven method for the appropriate choice of the modified gamma kernel estimator is also provided. An extensive simulation study compares the performance of this refined estimator to those of standard gamma kernel estimates and standard boundary corrected and adjusted fixed kernels. It is found that the finite sample performance of the proposed new estimator is superior in all settings. Two empirical applications based on high-frequency stock trading volumes and realized volatility forecasts demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methodology in practice.}

abstract = {In this paper we propose a smooth nonparametric estimation for the conditional probability density function based on a Bernstein polynomial representation. Our estimator can be written as a finite mixture of beta densities with data-driven weights. Using the Bernstein estimator of the conditional density function, we derive new estimators for the distribution function and conditional mean. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators, by proving their asymptotic normality and by providing their asymptotic bias and variance. Simulation results suggest that the proposed estimators can outperform the Nadaraya–Watson estimator and, in some specific setups, the local linear kernel estimators. Finally, we use our estimators for modeling the income in Italy, conditional on year from 1951 to 1998, and have another look at the well known Old Faithful Geyser data.}
